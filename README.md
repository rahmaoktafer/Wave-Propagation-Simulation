# Wave-Propagation-Simulation

The wave equation is a partial differential equation that defines the phenomenon of wave propagation. One of the methods that can be used to solve the wave equation is the Forward Time Centered Space method. In this project, wave propagation is visualized in 2D and 3D using the Matlab programming language.
